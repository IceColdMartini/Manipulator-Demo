```python
result = await engine.start_manipulator_conversation(
    customer_id="customer-123",
    business_id="business-456", 
    interaction_data={
        "product_id": "prod-789",
        "type": "ad_click",
        "platform": "facebook"
    }
)
# Returns: sophisticated welcome with product focus
```

#### Convincer Branch (Direct Messages):
```python
result = await engine.start_convincer_conversation(
    customer_id="customer-123",
    business_id="business-456",
    initial_message="I need help with team management",
    customer_context={"company_size": "50-100"}
)
# Returns: consultative discovery-focused response
```

#### Conversation Continuation:
```python
result = await engine.continue_conversation(
    conversation_id="conv-123",
    customer_message="What features does it include?",
    customer_context={"engagement_level": "high"}
)
# Returns: context-aware response with enhanced conversation management
```
